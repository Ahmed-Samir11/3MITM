# 📋 SUMMARY: How to Test 3MITM Yourself

## The 2-Command Test

---

## COMMAND 1 (Terminal 1)

```powershell
cd c:\Users\ahmed\OneDrive\Desktop\3MITM\3MITM
.\ibm\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python ingestion_api.py
```

**Keep this running! You'll see:**
```
Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

---

## COMMAND 2 (Terminal 2)

```powershell
cd c:\Users\ahmed\OneDrive\Desktop\3MITM\3MITM
.\ibm\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python attacker_agent.py
```

**You'll see the 3MITM framework execute!**

## WHAT HAPPENS

### Frame 1: Agent 1 (Reconnaissance)
```
[Agent 1] RECONNAISSANCE MITM:
  • Intercepting traffic at MITM position...
  • Identified 3 sensitive parameters
  • Reconnaissance complete ✓
```

✅ **Proves:** Agent 1 is analyzing traffic

---

### Frame 2: Agent 2 (Injection)
```
[Agent 2] INJECTION MITM:
  • Analyzing reconnaissance findings...
  • Crafting attack payload...
  • Payload injected into traffic stream ✓
```

✅ **Proves:** Agent 2 is crafting & injecting payloads

---

### Frame 3: Agent 3 (Exfiltration)
```
[Agent 3] EXFILTRATION MITM:
  • Monitoring for sensitive data...
  • Extracted 1 tokens/credentials
  • Preparing exfiltration to C&C server ✓
```

✅ **Proves:** Agent 3 is extracting & exfiltrating data

---

### Frame 4: Orchestration
```
[Orchestration] Forwarding attack to DevSecOps AI Agent...
[✓] Payload accepted for analysis (HTTP 202)
```

✅ **Proves:** All 3 agents coordinated, attack sent to defense

---

### Repeats for Attacks 2-5

Same pattern for:
- SQL Injection
- XSS Injection  
- Insecure Deserialization
- Sensitive Data Exposure

---

### Final Summary

```
Attack Results:
  Hardcoded Credentials           → ✓ Detected & Remediated        
  SQL Injection                   → ✓ Detected & Remediated        
  XSS Injection                   → ✓ Detected & Remediated        
  Insecure Deserialization        → ✓ Detected & Remediated        
  Sensitive Data Exposure         → ✓ Detected & Remediated        

Agents Summary:
  • Agent 1 (Reconnaissance): Analyzed 5 traffic flows
  • Agent 2 (Injection):      Crafted 5 attack payloads
  • Agent 3 (Exfiltration):  Prepared 5 data exfiltrations
```

✅ **Proves:** Complete 3MITM framework working!

---

## VERIFY RESULTS

### 1. Check Jira
Visit: https://3mitm.atlassian.net/projects/SMS

You should see **5 new Task tickets** created automatically.

✅ **Proves:** Defense system detected all attacks

### 2. Check Slack
Your Slack should have **5 security alert messages**.

✅ **Proves:** Defense system notified the team

### 3. Check Flask Terminal (Terminal 1)
It should show successful processing of all 5 attacks.

✅ **Proves:** API received and analyzed all attacks

## WHAT THIS DEMONSTRATES

### The 3MITM Framework
```
Attack 1 → Agent 1 analyze → Agent 2 inject → Agent 3 extract
Attack 2 → Agent 1 analyze → Agent 2 inject → Agent 3 extract
Attack 3 → Agent 1 analyze → Agent 2 inject → Agent 3 extract
Attack 4 → Agent 1 analyze → Agent 2 inject → Agent 3 extract
Attack 5 → Agent 1 analyze → Agent 2 inject → Agent 3 extract
       ↓
    Orchestrated Attack Campaign
       ↓
    Defense System Detection & Response
```

### Why It's Novel
- **Traditional MITM:** One attacker, one action
- **3MITM:** Three agents, three coordinated actions per attack
- **Result:** More sophisticated, multi-stage attacks
